# Advanced-Programming-Project-HSG
For our project we have decided to code a prototype of a WebApplication which allows Swiss homeowners to get a quick prediction of the price of their property based on its characteristics (e.g. square-meters, location, etc.) as well as a comparison to the market. The predictive model is a Random Forest, which we have trained with data that we scraped (April 2024) from [Immoscout24.ch](https://www.immoscout24.ch/en), the leading Swiss real estate market place.
