# Advanced-Programming-Project-HSG
For our project we have decided to code a prototype of a WebApplication which allows Swiss homeowners to get a quick prediction of the price of their property based on its characteristics (e.g. square-meters, location, etc.) as well as a comparison to the market. The predictive model is a Random Forest, which we have trained with data that we scraped (April 2024) from [Immoscout24.ch](https://www.immoscout24.ch/en), the leading Swiss real estate market place.

Authors of this project are: 
- Yves Gr√§del (yves.graedel@student.unisg.ch)
- Jonas Lehmann (jonas.lehmann@student.unisg.ch)
- Marc Berger (marc.berger@student.unisg.ch)

This file provides a description of the project and is structured as follows: 
- Demonstration of the Front End of the Web Application 
- How to run the code
- Explanation of Web App components
- Explanation of Web Scraper & Data Cleaning
- Explanation of Machine Learning Model

## 1) Demonstration of the Front End of the Web App
