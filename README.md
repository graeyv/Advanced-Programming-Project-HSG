# Advanced-Programming-Project-HSG
For our project we have decided to code a prototype of a WebApplication which allows Swiss homeowners to get a quick prediction of the price of their property based on its characteristics (e.g. square-meters, location, etc.) as well as a comparison to the market. The predictive model is a Random Forest, which we have trained with data that we scraped (April 2024) from [Immoscout24.ch](https://www.immoscout24.ch/en), the leading Swiss real estate market place.

Authors of this project are: 
- Yves Gr√§del (yves.graedel@student.unisg.ch)
- Jonas Lehmann (jonas.lehmann@student.unisg.ch)
- Marc Berger (marc.berger@student.unisg.ch)

This file provides a description of the project and is structured as follows: 
- Demonstration of the Front End of the Web Application 
- How to run the code
- Explanation of Web App components
- Explanation of Web Scraper & Data Cleaning
- Explanation of Machine Learning Model

## Disclaimer
This project has been realized with the help of online sources such as https://stackoverflow.com/ and with the help of OpenAIs' LLM ChatGPT 4.

## 2) How to run the code

The code used to scrape the data (NAME), clean the data (NAME) and fit the predictive model (NAME) can be run independently from the code used to create the WebApp.
